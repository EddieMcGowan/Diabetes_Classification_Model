**Important:**  
- The dataset file name when downloaded is `diabetes_dataset00.csv`. Rename as "diabetes_dataset.csv" (remove the 00) before running the code. This is to ensure there is no confusion, as the dataset is only one part.
- It should be placed inside the `data/` folder, which is one level below `DSCI 441 Milestone 2.ipynb`.
